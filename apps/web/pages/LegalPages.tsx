                <li><strong>legitimate interests</strong> – where necessary for running and improving Takween, preventing misuse, and maintaining platform safety;</li>

            <h2>Data retention</h2>
            <p>We keep personal data only for as long as reasonably necessary for the purposes described in this policy, including account administration, legal compliance, safeguarding, dispute resolution and financial record-keeping.</p>

            <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 font-medium mb-8"><strong>Effective date:</strong> 7 March 2026</p>
            <p>These Terms & Conditions govern your use of the Takween website, platform and tutoring services. By accessing or using Takween, you agree to these terms.</p>

            <h2>1. About Takween</h2>
            <p>Takween provides access to educational services, including tutoring sessions, learning support, scheduling tools, digital content and related services.</p>

            <h2>2. Eligibility</h2>
            <p>You may use Takween only if you can lawfully enter into a contract. If the student is under 18, a parent or legal guardian may be required to register, manage bookings, approve payments, or supervise use of the platform.</p>

            <h2>3. Accounts</h2>
            <p>You are responsible for ensuring that account information is accurate and up to date. You must keep login details secure and must not share your account with unauthorised users. We may suspend or restrict accounts where we reasonably believe there has been misuse, fraud, abusive behaviour, safeguarding risk, or breach of these terms.</p>

            <h2>4. Bookings and services</h2>
            <p>Tutoring sessions are subject to tutor availability, confirmation, payment status and platform rules. We may change tutors, reschedule sessions, or amend service delivery where reasonably necessary, including for safeguarding, operational or technical reasons.</p>

            <h2>5. Fees and payment</h2>
            <p>All fees will be shown before purchase. By purchasing a lesson, package or subscription, you agree to pay the displayed charges and any clearly stated recurring fees. UK rules for online and distance selling require businesses to provide key pre-contract information including business identity, price, billing period, contract duration, cancellation conditions and payment arrangements before an order is placed.</p>

            <h2>6. Cancellations and refunds</h2>
            <p>Our cancellation, refund and rescheduling rules will apply as stated at checkout or in the relevant booking policy. Nothing in these terms removes any statutory rights you may have under consumer law.</p>

            <h2>7. User conduct</h2>
            <p>You must not:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>use Takween for unlawful, harmful or abusive purposes;</li>
                <li>harass, threaten or discriminate against tutors, students, parents or staff;</li>
                <li>record, reproduce or distribute sessions without permission where not allowed;</li>
                <li>upload malicious software or attempt to interfere with platform security;</li>
                <li>impersonate another person or provide false information.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>8. Safeguarding and safety</h2>
            <p>Where students under 18 use Takween, all users must comply with our Safeguarding Use Policy. We may monitor, restrict, suspend or report activity where we reasonably consider it necessary to protect learners, tutors, staff or the wider public.</p>

            <h2>9. Intellectual property</h2>
            <p>Unless otherwise stated, all content on the Takween website and platform, including branding, text, graphics, lesson materials and software elements, belongs to Takween or its licensors. You may not copy, redistribute or commercially exploit content without permission.</p>

            <h2>10. Limitation of liability</h2>
            <p>We do not exclude or limit liability where it would be unlawful to do so. Otherwise, to the extent permitted by law, Takween is not liable for indirect or consequential loss, loss of profit, or losses arising from matters outside our reasonable control. Any limitations must still be fair and transparent under the Consumer Rights Act 2015. Unfair consumer terms are not binding.</p>

            <h2>11. Termination</h2>
            <p>We may suspend or terminate access where these terms are breached, payment is overdue, or we reasonably believe suspension is necessary for legal, security or safeguarding reasons.</p>

            <h2>12. Changes to these terms</h2>
            <p>We may update these terms from time to time. The latest version posted on our website will apply from its effective date.</p>

            <h2>13. Governing law</h2>
            <p>These terms are governed by the law of England and Wales, unless mandatory local consumer law applies otherwise.</p>

This Safeguarding Use Policy sets out the expectations for students, parents, guardians, tutors, staff and any person using the Takween platform.</p>
            <p>This policy is informed by UK safeguarding principles.

                <li>not exchange personal contact details unless expressly authorised by Takween;</li>
                <li>never meet a child in person through Takween without appropriate parental knowledge, risk controls and explicit approval where required;</li>
                <li>report any safeguarding concern immediately.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>5. Parent and guardian responsibilities</h2>

                <li>provide accurate contact and emergency information;</li>
                <li>supervise students where appropriate for their age and needs;</li>
                <li>report concerns, unusual behaviour or safety issues promptly;</li>
                <li>ensure students understand respectful and safe online behaviour.</li>
            </ul>

                <li>account verification;</li>
                <li>monitored communications;</li>
                <li>session records or audit logs where lawfully used;</li>
                <li>platform restrictions or moderation tools;</li>
                <li>escalation to internal safeguarding leads or external authorities where required.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>7. Reporting concerns</h2>
            <p>Any safeguarding concern must be reported as soon as possible to <strong>safeguarding@takweentutors.com</strong>. Concerns may include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>inappropriate messages or behaviour;</li>
                <li>attempts to move communications off-platform improperly;</li>

                <li>any situation where a child or vulnerable person may be at risk.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>8. Action we may take</h2>
            <p>Where we identify a safeguarding concern, Takween may:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>suspend or restrict accounts;</li>
                <li>investigate communications or activity where lawful and necessary;</li>
                <li>contact parents or guardians where appropriate;</li>
                <li>refer matters to social services, police, local authorities, schools, or other relevant agencies;</li>
                <li>retain relevant information where required for safeguarding, legal or investigative purposes.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>9. Confidentiality</h2>
            <p>Safeguarding information will be handled sensitively, but it may be shared on a need-to-know basis where necessary to protect a child or comply with the law. Safeguarding should not be kept secret where doing so could place someone at risk.</p>

            <h2>10. Review</h2>
            <p>This policy will be reviewed regularly and updated where needed to reflect legal, operational and safeguarding developments.</p>
